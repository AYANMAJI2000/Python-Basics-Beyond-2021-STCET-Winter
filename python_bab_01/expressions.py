# Expression
# Syntax that involves operators and operands
# and is often interpreted by the interpreter
a = 12
b = 3
# c = a + b  # 15
e = 13
f = 5 
# print(c)

# Operators
# Symbols that are used to be operated on operands

# Arithmetic Operators
# Add Operator
# c = a + b
# print(c)

# Subtract Operator
# c = a - b
# print(c)

# Multiplication Operator
# c = a * b
# print(c)

# Division Operator
# c = e / f
# print(c)

# Floor Division Operator
# c = e // f
# print(c)

# Modulus Operator
# c = e % f
# print(c)

# Exponentiation Operator
# 12^3
# c = b ** f
# print(c)
# print(2 ** 3)


#-------------

# Comparison Operator
# Boolean

# Less Than
# 12 < 3
# c = a < b
# print(c)

# Less Than Equal To
# 12 <= 3
# Is 12 less than equal to 3
# True(Yes) / False(No)
# c = a <= b
# print(c)

# Greater Than
# 12 > 3
# c = a > b
# print(c)

# Greater Than Equal To
# 12 >= 3
# Is 12 greater than equal to 3
# True(Yes) / False(No)
# c = a >= b
# print(c)
# print(12 >= 12)

# Equal To
# 12 == 3
# Is 12 equal to 3
# True(Yes) / False(No)
# c = a == b
# print(13 == 13.0)

# Logical Operators
# and, or, not

# and

# print( a > b and e > f)
# print(a > b or e > f)
# print(True and True)
# print(True and False)

# print(True or False)
# print(True or True)

# print(not True)
# print(not False)

# Binary Operators
# left shift
# print(a << 2)
# 001100
# 110000

# Right Shift
# print(a >> 2)


# Expressions
# print((2 + 3) * 4 )
# print(2 + 3 * 4)

# print(2 ** 3 * 4 + 5)
# print(5 + 4 * 2 ** 3)
# print(2 ** 3 * (4 + 5))

# print(2 ** (3 * (1 + 1)))
